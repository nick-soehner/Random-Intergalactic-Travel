# Random Interglactic Travel
## Codecademy Full Stack Enginner Portfolio Project
For this project I created code that would randomly generate a rocket, planet, and life form for our daring travelers to explore.
I hope to in the future update this project with HTML and CSS to give visuals and useablity to anyone who will encounter it.
But for now I leave it at this! Hope you enjoy!
